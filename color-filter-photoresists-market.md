<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Color Filter Photoresists Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Negative Photoresists</li><li>Positive Photoresists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Color filter photoresists are essential for manufacturing displays, sensors, and imaging systems, featuring two main types: negative photoresists and positive photoresists. Negative photoresists polymerize when exposed to light, resulting in a hard mask where light hits, ideal for creating intricate designs. Conversely, positive photoresists become soluble in developer solutions upon exposure, making it easier to produce detailed patterns by removing the exposed areas. Both types play critical roles in the semiconductor and electronics industries, influencing performance and precision in color filter production.</p></p>
