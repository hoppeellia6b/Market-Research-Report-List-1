<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cranial Fixation Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Material</li><li>Non-Absorbable Material</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cranial fixation systems are essential in neurosurgery for stabilizing cranial structures post-surgery. The market is divided into two main types: absorbable and non-absorbable materials. Absorbable materials, made from substances that gradually dissolve in the body, eliminate the need for removal and reduce long-term complications. In contrast, non-absorbable materials, typically made from metals or polymers, offer permanent stabilization but require surgical removal if needed. Both types play crucial roles in improving patient outcomes and surgical efficacy in cranial procedures.</p></p>
