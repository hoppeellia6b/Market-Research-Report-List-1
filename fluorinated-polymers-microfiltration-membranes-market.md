<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fluorinated Polymers Microfiltration Membranes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cross Flow</li><li>Direct Flow</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fluorinated polymers microfiltration membranes are categorized into two main types: cross-flow and direct-flow systems. Cross-flow filtration allows the feed solution to flow parallel to the membrane surface, promoting continuous filtration and reducing fouling. This method is efficient for separating particles while minimizing clogging. Conversely, direct-flow filtration directs the feed solution perpendicular to the membrane surface, which is simpler but may lead to higher fouling rates. Both types serve distinct applications in water treatment, biotechnology, and food processing industries.</p></p>
