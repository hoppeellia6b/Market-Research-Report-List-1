<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Seismic Survey Ship Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Streamer Ship</li><li>Multi-Streamer Ship</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The seismic survey ship market consists of two primary types: single-streamer ships and multi-streamer ships. Single-streamer ships utilize one cable for data collection, making them ideal for smaller surveys in shallow waters or less complex geological areas. In contrast, multi-streamer ships employ several cables simultaneously, allowing for extensive data acquisition over larger areas and deeper waters. The choice between these ships depends on the survey's scale, depth, and the specific geological features being assessed.</p></p>
