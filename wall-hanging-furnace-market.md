<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wall Hanging Furnace Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Noncondensing Type</li><li>Condensing Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The wall hanging furnace market is primarily divided into two types: non-condensing and condensing types. Non-condensing furnaces operate at higher temperatures, expelling combustion gases without recovering usable heat, making them less efficient. In contrast, condensing furnaces utilize advanced technology to capture and recycle exhaust heat, resulting in improved energy efficiency and lower operating costs. While non-condensing units are often less expensive upfront, condensing models offer long-term savings and reduced environmental impact, driving their growing popularity in the market.</p></p>
