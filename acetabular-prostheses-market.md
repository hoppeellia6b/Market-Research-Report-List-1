<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acetabular Prostheses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cementless</li><li>Cemented</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The acetabular prostheses market can be categorized into cemented and cementless types, each serving distinct needs in hip replacement surgeries. Cemented prostheses utilize surgical cement to secure the implant to the bone, offering immediate stability and are often preferred for older patients with weaker bone structures. In contrast, cementless prostheses rely on bone in-growth for fixation, promoting long-term stability and typically used for younger, more active patients who have better bone quality. Both types aim to enhance patient mobility and reduce complications.</p></p>
